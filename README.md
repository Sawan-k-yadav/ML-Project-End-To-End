# End to End Machine Learning Project

# To create a new repository on the command line

# git init
# git add README.md
# git commit -m "first commit"
# git branch -M main
# git remote add origin https://github.com/Sawan-k-yadav/ML-Project-End-To-End.git
# git push -u origin main

# When any file or folder already commited to github then it won't be removed by adding .filename . So in # those situations we need to manually remove the file
# Remove them manually:
## Use git rm -r --cached artifacts/* to remove them from the index (staging area).
## Commit the changes with git commit -m "Remove artifacts from version control"
